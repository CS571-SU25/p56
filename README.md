# README

**HI DEAR TAs**,  
If you are reading this itâ€™s because my project for this is oddly complicated and testing it as well.
The end goal for this project is to be hosted on my person server computer to be used as a personal cloud system.
Due to this, I expect/want to host both the react and python components on that device. However this just complicates the testing

---
## To test locally:

I have provided the `backendFileManager.py` in the `src` folder.  
That should be ran on the same machine for testing purposes.

**I am so sorry that this is so complex for no reason.**
